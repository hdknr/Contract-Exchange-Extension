<section title="Responding a CX Contract in OpenID Assertion">
<t>
If a RP request OpenID Artifact Binding assertion request and there is a CX Signed Contract to be bound to that, the OP MUST return it as a "cx" member of the assertion JSON object.

    "cx" : {
                "type" :   "http://specs.openid.net/cx/1.0/#signed_contract",
                 ... ( OTHER CX SIGNED CONTRACT JSON MEMBERS ) ...
             } 
}
    ]]></artwork>

<t>
But if no CX Signed Contract is available at the time when RP requests the assertion, OP MUST return CX Status JSON object as "cx" member of assertion JSON object.

<section title="Verifying Contract">

<t>
If the "cx" member of assertion JSON object is a CX Signed Contract JSON object, RP MUST verify the signature of Magic Envelope first. RP MUST store the CX Signed Contract if it is valid Magic Envelope.
</t>


<t>
RP SHOULD explain to the End User that a CX Contract has been successfully created and now RP is ready to request data according to the contract.
</t>

<t>
If the "cx" member is a CX Status JSON object, RP SHOULD explain to the End User that a CX Contract has not been created yet at OP  and the reason by "status" member of the CX Status JSON object. RP MAY be notified later that a CX Contract is created by the OP.
