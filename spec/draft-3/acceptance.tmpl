Acceptance is a copy form original Request "payload"  with extra parameters including End User's privacy data added by Signagory and End User.
Signatory MUST produce two CX Acceptances for a single CX Request, one is for Client's Contract Part and the other is for Server's Contract Part.
Privacy data like canonical identifier SHOULD be different from each other.
