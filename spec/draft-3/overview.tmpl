<t>The contract exchange extension(CX) is OpenID extension identified by the URI "http://openid.net/srv/cx/1.0/#". The contract is the document to prove that all parties bound to that have rights and obligations on consuming and providing services between each other.</t>
<t/>
<t>CX protocol is based on  {{ xref.OPENID_AB }} and some {{ xref.JSON }} messages structure used in CX are defined to exchange non-repudiate message. When an End User starts consuming a CX-based service at a RP(Proposer), the RP compose a Proposal JSON which is compiled with OpenID Artifact Binding Request files defined by parties to be bound to the CX service and contract. The RP starts OpenID Artifact Binding session with the Proposal to the OP(Signatory) specified by the End User, the End User is authenticated at the OP and agrees to compose the CX Contract, and finally the OP provides the CX Contract in OpenID Artifact Binding assertion to the RP.</t>
<t/>
<t>With sharing Contract in advance and presenting Contract identfier at specified endpoints, the RP and other Parties bound to the Contract can be authenticated and request data services.</t>
